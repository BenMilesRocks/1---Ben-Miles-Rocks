# Ben Miles Rocks

This project is to create a website for blues musician Ben Miles.

## Project Goals

The main priority for this website is to make it easier for fans to purchase merchandise directly from the artist. They already have a [Big Cartel](https://benmilesrocks.bigcartel.com/products) store in place, so links to this should be prominent at multiple points in the website.

A secondary goal is to act as a showcase for both new fans and people interested in booking Ben for live shows and Radio / TV appearances. This means embedding music and video into the page is a high priority, which is made easier by their previous work being readily available on YouTube and Spotify. 

Thirdly there is also the need to drive new fans to Ben's existing social media pages, so links to these will need to be promiently placed.

Finally, there is a strong drive to make this website easy to use on mobile devices. As a result the whole site will need to be responsive, resizing elements to best fit the screen they are being displayed on.
