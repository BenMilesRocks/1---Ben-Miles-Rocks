# Ben Miles Rocks



## Project Goals

This project is to create a website for blues musician Ben Miles.

[The deployed version of the site is available here](https://benmilesrocks.github.io/1---Ben-Miles-Rocks/)

The main priority for this website is to make it easier for fans to purchase merchandise directly from the artist. They already have a [Big Cartel](https://benmilesrocks.bigcartel.com/products) store in place, so links to this should be prominent at multiple points in the website.

A secondary goal is to act as a showcase for both new fans and people interested in booking Ben for live shows and Radio / TV appearances. This means embedding music and video into the page is a high priority, which is made easier by their previous work being readily available on YouTube and Spotify. 

Thirdly there is also the need to drive new fans to Ben's existing social media pages, so links to these will need to be promiently placed.

Finally, there is a strong drive to make this website easy to use on mobile devices. As a result the whole site will need to be responsive, resizing elements to best fit the screen they are being displayed on.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The color palette was chosen with colours picked from the Hero Image on index.htmtl. The intention was to create a visual style that was cohesive and tied the Hero Image with the rest of the site, giving it an aesthetic continuity.

The color palette was put together using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/fafafa-0d1512-0a3342-c4c5c4-1f565d), using the color picker tool on the hero image to identify color hex values.

### Typography

Typography posed an interesting challenge in this site, as I wanted to maintain a simple, easy to read style whilst making it visually interesting and evocative at the same time.

All fonts were sourced through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) not only for ease of use but also for reliability and stability.

I used the [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) font for menu and body text, as this is a clear and simple san-serif font ideal for communicating information clearly.

For the page Logo I used [Ultra](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ultra?query=ultra), which is a very bold serif font. This also is quite evocotive of old western movies which ties in nicely with the americana-influenced music that the page is showcasing, giving users a visual indication of the style of music that the artist plays.

For the section headers I used [Diplomata SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Diplomata+SC?query=Diplomata+SC), a bold serif font which is capitalised. Much like Ultra this is quite evocotive of old western movies, playing into the americana theme and giving the page a distinctive style that ties in with the music of the artist.

### Imagery

The Hero Image on index.html is a live photograph of the artist in concert, which was chosen to evoke the energy and tone of the live shows. Not only does this keep the subject of the site clear in the user's mind, but also helps create interest and communicates the type of music you would hear from this artist.

The other source of imagery is the video thumbnails found on index.html and music.html, which are very bright and colourful to tie in with the energy of the artist's music. Relying on these to convey imagery not only makes the site more engaging (as a video with music is going to hold the user's attention more than a still image) but it also plays into the site's philosophy of "let the music do the talking". It helps communicate the music of the artist in a clear and obvious manner without the need for excessive text that might bore visitors to the site.

### Wireframe

Wireframes were created for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop using Wireframe.cc .

**Homepage**

*Desktop*

*Tablet*

**Music Page**

**Contact Page**

*Mobile*

As you can see these wireframes have a navigation bar and social media links on the top and bottom of the site for Desktop and Tablet, which I changed during development to have the navigation at the top and the social media links in the footer. Not only was this clearer for the user to follow but it was more visually appealing as well.

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, music page, contact page and a message sent page.

### Accessibility

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

This website is built with HTML 5 and styled using CSS.

There are also JavaScript elements, but these are provided by external libraries (in particular [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/)).

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

I used [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework to make use of its responsive elements, and [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/) for the API on the Contact page.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons for the Social Media links. 

To edit my code I used Visual Studio, and I used Git for version control.
